**Before publishing the exercise sheet please test with all solutions whether the full points can be reached.**

## Nice to have:
- Append the deadlock function to automate/ change the questions about deadlocks.

## ToDo:
Change deadlock commits. This is still by hand but no evaluation exists. (Maybe look in old exercise sheet.)
